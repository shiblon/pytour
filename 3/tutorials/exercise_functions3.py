"""Exercise: Functions and If (3)

This time we'll use the |sorted| builtin function,
along with some slicing and |if| statement work,
to make the tests pass.

First, a couple of reminders are in order:

- |sorted| accepts a sequence and returns a sorted
  list.

- Lists can be joined together using |+|, like
  this: |[1, 2] + [3, 4]|.

- Slices can use negative values to indicate
  "distance from the right side", like this: |(0,
  1, 2, 3)[-2:]|, which produces the last two
  elements |(2, 3)| (it means "start at 2 from the
  right and take everything from there"). You may
  want to review slices quickly before diving in.

- The length of a sequence is obtained with |len|.

Exercise

- Write the |kind_of_sorted| function and make the
  module docstring pass. It accepts one argument:
  a list, and returns that list with _all
  but the first two and last two elements sorted_.
  The first two and last two elements should
  remain in the same place. Hint: what should
  happen when the list is small or empty? How
  small?

>>> kind_of_sorted([8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0])

>>> kind_of_sorted([5, 4, 3, 2, 1])
[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

  Now check this out - creates a list of
  characters from a string, gets it kind of
  sorted, and joins the result back into a string:

>>> ''.join(kind_of_sorted(list("aragonite")))
'araginote'

>>> kind_of_sorted([])
