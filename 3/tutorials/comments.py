"""Comments

Python ignores **comments**: bits of text that
start with |#| and extend to the end of the line.
They are strictly for humans to read, and do not
affect how your program runs.

  # This is a comment.

Comments are useful for making notes to yourself
or others about how the program's code works, but
should not be used as the primary form of
documentation in Python (more on that later).

Note that the leader |#| has to stand alone
syntactically to form a comment; if it appears
inside of a string, for example, it is just part
of the text.

Exercises

- Print a string with a comment leader inside of
  it, e.g., |print "# a comment?"|.
"""

# This is a comment. Comments start with '#' and
# extend to the end of the current line.

print "hey"
print # This just prints a blank line.
print "hello"
