"""Generators for Refactoring

Now that we know how to make our own generators,
let's do some refactoring to make use of this idea
and clean up the code a bit. We'll start by
splitting out the |clean_lines| function, which
basically just skips blank lines and comments,
stripping unnecessary space.

This notion of converting one iterator into
another is prevalent in Python. As one rather
common example, the |enumerate| builtin converts
an iterable over items into an iterable over
|(index,item)| pairs. You built something similar
earlier.

Generators make refactoring sequence operations
really easy, even operations that need to remember
something about past elements. Without them,
separating functionality like this would be hard
or sometimes even impossible.

Exercises

- Look carefully at "clean_lines" and make sure
  you understand how it works.

- Use "enumerate" to get line numbers with the
  data, and emit that line number in the
  ValueError message. Note that in string
  formatting, {0} means "the first argument". You
  can put any number in there, so long as it
  matches the position of what you pass to
  |format|. So, you could use |{2}| for the line
  number if you want.

Changes: we now clean out comments and blank lines
in a different function, and the error message for
bad dates has the line number in it.
