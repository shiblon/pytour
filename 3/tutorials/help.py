"""Getting Help

One function that is built into out-of-browser
Python interpreters is |help|. This is a very
useful function, because it gives you basic
documentation on just about anything you want.

For this in-browser tutorial, the *help* function
is not functional.

You can also run "pydoc" from the commandline, or
access http://python.org/doc/ directly or from the
link above.

Exercises

- Go to the *Docs* link, find Python 3.x, Library
  Reference, and click on
  |Built-in Functions| (direct link here: https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html).

__doc__ = """Getting Help

Help is available in normal Python interpreters by
calling the 'help' function. It can sometimes be
more useful than 'dir'.
