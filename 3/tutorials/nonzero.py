"""A Tale of Truth

The |if| statement executes its code block when
its **condition is True**. This is a nice, simple
rule, but it's actually a lie. Really, it executes
if its condition is **nonzero**.

In a nutshell, a value is "nonzero" if it is
_something_ instead of _nothing_. The special
"nothing" value |None|, for example, always
evaluates to |False|. Some more examples follow:

  False      True
  ------------------------
  0          -5
  []         ['x', 1, ...]
  ()         (4, 2, ...)
  ''         'hi'

Typically, there is only one way for a thing to be
|False| ("zero"), and anything else is |True|
("nonzero").

Exercises

- |True| and |False| are called "Boolean" types,
  after mathematician George Boole. Try calling
  the |bool| builtin to find out whether something
  evaluates to |True| or |False|. For example, try
  |print bool(0.0)| or a tiny value like |print
  bool(1e-20)|.

- Try evaluating |bool('0')|. Is it what you
  expected? Why?
