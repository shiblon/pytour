"""Variables

A **variable** is a place to remember something.
You assign a value to a variable using the
**assignment operator** (a single |=|) like this:

  a = "hi"

Now the variable |a| contains the string |"hi"|.

In Python, variables spring into existence when they
are _assigned a value_. They do not exist before being
assigned, so accessing one without first assigning it
is an error.

A valid **variable name** can contain letters,
numbers, and the |_| character, but cannot begin
with a number. A variable can contain any kind of
value.

Exercises

- Try assiging to a variable name that starts with a number
  (like 1eet). See what happens.

- Assign a new variable to an existing one, e.g.,
  |b = a|. Print it.
"""

a = "hi there"  # 'a' now contains a string of text.
print a

a = 10  # 'a' now contains an integer number.
print a

my_longer_varname = 14
print my_longer_varname

# Until assigned, variables cannot be accessed.
print i_dont_exist  # Not yet assigned!
