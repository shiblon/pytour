"""Exercise: Functions and If (2)

For this exercise, you get to write the whole
function out, including the name and arguments.
Docstrings are optional, but will produce more
bonus points.

Exercises

- Write a function |every_other_arg| that accepts any number of
  arguments and returns a list containg every
  other one. Recall that |[::2]| will produce
  every other element of a sequence, and |*args|
  will collect all function arguments into a
  single tuple.
