"""Hello, Python!

Welcome to Python, a very fun language to use and
learn!

Here we have a simple "Hello World!" program. All
you have to do is print, and you have output. Try
running it now, either by clicking *Run*, or
pressing *Shift-Enter*.

What happened? This tutorial contains a *Python
interpreter*. It starts at the top of your program
(or _script_) and does what you tell it to until
it reaches the bottom. Here, we have told it to
do exactly one thing: **print** a **string** (text
surrounded by quotation marks) to the output
window, and it has.

The word |print| is a special command in Python.
It instructs the interperter to output what you
tell it to. In this tutorial, we capture that
output in the window below the code so that you
can easily see it.

We will get very comfortable with this as the tutorial goes on. Meanwhile, let's talk about the tutorial itself:

- The Table of Contents is above, marked *TOC*.

- *Page-Up* and *Page-Down* keys can be used to navigate.

- Code can be run with the *Run* button or *Shift-Enter*.

- Check out the options in the *Run* menu (the arrow). Among other things,
  you can see what you have changed from the original slide. The tutorial
  will try to remember those changes for a long time.

Exercises

- Try removing each of the quotation marks in
  turn. What happens?

- Change the string to say hello specifically to you.

- Print 'Hello, Python!' using two strings instead
  of one, like this: |print 'Hello', 'Python!'|.
  What did |print| do for you automatically?
"""

print 'Hello, Python!'
